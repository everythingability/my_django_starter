# My Django Starter Project

Everyone has their own preferences about how projects should be set up. These are mine - and they are based on the idea of making a "working site" that does all the things you always need to do, like a home page for example, without dictating how to do it. Working from a working site is far easier than jumping from page to page in the Django documentation figuring out which bits should go into the respective files.

I'm no where near being even a competent coder, and tend to make quick experiments and prototypes rather than full-on webdev, so what I need is simplicity. I tried Flask but prefer working small in Django.

## Repo

git clone https://github.com/everythingability/my_django_starter.git

Of course the issue will be, that when I use this starter, for my next project, will I go back to this project and keep it updated with what I've learned?
